    page 1 (ie.indix.html) - This is my home page which gives a brief intoduction to my website
    page 2 (ie.hardware.html) - This page unlike home page informs and intoduses to all the importent parts of a PC build
    page 3 (ie.membership.html) - This page helps individuals to join us as a member on our website
    page 4 (ie.aboutus.html) - this is the final page which tells us all the best parts of the website
